Data attributes of the command call should copy the value from the command.

the comarision operator can be concatenated in python, but the meaning have some subtle difference with other operator.
So I can not make pipeline with them. Just use the left shift and right shift operator << >> instead.
This is better. pipeline implies shift. - -- == << >> |

The CommandClass can be used to refactoring optparse more elegantly.

limitations:
  use ==: the precedence of "cmda -a==b -c==d  -e" is wrong.
    # must use //
  # the argument should follow the command or follow the option without ==value after it.
    
  the option should not follow the option with ==value it directly.
  
  cmda >> cmdb >> cmdc -run can only execute cmdc because of the precedence.
    # so use "cmda >> cmdb >> cmdc >run".
  
  !!! How about changing the precedence of the operator by whitespace?
  It's necessary using % for the argument of the command and using to avoid ambiguity.
  
  How about cmd (-o==option)?
