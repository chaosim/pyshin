   CommandClass:
    "class SomeCommand(Command)" produces an instance of CommandClass
    CommandClass.__call__ produces CommandCall
    options should be in options of  the command
    "Method" in the command is just a function and becomes true method of the 
      instance of CommandCall
  CommandCall:
    Pipeline operators | > < produce CommandCallChain
    The output of the previous call becomes the input of next call
    "cmd -o" adds the option o to cmd.options
    Meeting with options repeated raises RepeatOptionError
    The option followed after commandcall must be an option of the Command, otherwise raises InvalidOption
